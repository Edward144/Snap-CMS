Snap CMS is a basic CMS based on the look and functionality of Wordpress. 

Installation is as simple as copying the files to the required directory, and setting up a MySQL database. 
On initial visit to the CMS you should be redirected to a setup page where you can enter the Database name, Host, Username, and Password for
your MySQL database. All required tables will then be setup.

After setup you can login by going to /login and entering Username: admin and Password: changeme

Styles and templates can both be changed by creating and editing files in /templates and /admin/templates respectively.
